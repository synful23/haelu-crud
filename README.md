# haelu-crud

Hi guys, this is a small example of a CRUD system made specifically to fit the assessment for Haelu. 

The system uses a mix of HTML, CSS, PHP/Javascript, PDO, AJAX, JQuery and bootstrap.

I believe what I've built fits the criteria for a small internal system.

This is intended to be used for a community of gamers to determine everyone's favourite games. A community owner could use this system to find out what games their community enjoys playing, which would give the owner a greater insight into what to focus the community gaming events on.
